Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
  help you see the bug that was introduced?

A: It makes it very easy to see the changes that were made, and only
  those changes, so that you can quickly tell which change caused the error.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you
  a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: It can help me learn from past mistakes that have caused errors, and also
  help me see how I've improved my efficiency in operations over time.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
  multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
  treat each file separately?

A: GDocs is built for individual files that rarely relate to/link to
  one another in a meaningful way where simultaneous changelogs would be
  helpful, whereas Git is built for code, where multiple files often need
  to be changed at once to implement something new.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the
  history of files?

A: git log shows a history of commits, from newest to oldest, with notes
  from the committer on what was changed. You can then use git diff to
  find the changes made between that commit and the previous one (the next
  one down in the list)

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want
  to try using Git for?

A: I'd like to test it to track some tweaks I want to make on projects I
  started in the Introduction to Coding Nanodegree.
