Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: It informs get that this directory (and subdirs) are a repo to watch,
  and it adds the .git folder into the directory to prepare to track.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and
  the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: Much like taking two steps to commit a change into an SQL database,
  the staging area pulls pieces together, then requires a commit to ensure
  you have a chance to validate your intended results before you commit them.
